- ðŸ“Œ speechrecognition- this will understand the speech user says to the ai. To download type this in cmd or terminial `pip install SpeechRecognition`

- ðŸ“Œ datetime- this will get the time for the ai to tell. to download type this in cmd or terminal `pip install datetime`

- ðŸ“Œ wikipedia- this will help you get results from wikipedia directly. To download type this in cmd or terminal `pip install wikipedia`

- ðŸ“Œ Pyaudio= in order to make your ai listen you you are gonna need pyaudio from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/). After downloading the file from here open cmd and cd the directory with `cd /yourdirectory` and type `pip install yourfilename.whl` to install it!
